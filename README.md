# pyTable-Visualizer
# When runsearches the local directory for a inp or hdf5 data file, imports and reads it, and outputs a set of image files based on colored ion counts. Currently hard-coded to read in 256x256 raster images and output the same. Ion count visualizations can be modified based on desired size and ion scaling (for helping to see small or really large ion counts).
